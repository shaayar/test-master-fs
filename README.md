# **Automated Testing Framework for Web Applications**

## **Project Name:** TestMaster: Automated Web Testing Suite

## **Introduction**
TestMaster is an automated testing framework designed to execute end-to-end tests on web applications across multiple browsers. It provides detailed test reports and an easy-to-use interface for managing and executing test cases. The framework leverages modern web testing tools like Selenium WebDriver and integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing.

## **Core Features**

### **1. Cross-Browser Testing**
- Supports Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.
- Uses Selenium WebDriver for automation.
- Tests can be configured for different screen sizes and resolutions.

### **2. End-to-End Testing**
- Automates user interactions such as clicking, form submission, and navigation.
- Supports authentication testing (e.g., login/logout validation).
- Captures screenshots during test execution.

### **3. Test Management**
- Web-based UI to create, edit, and manage test cases.
- Ability to organize tests by project.
- Option to enable/disable specific tests.

### **4. Test Execution & Reports**
- Runs automated tests and returns pass/fail results.
- Generates reports in JSON and HTML formats.
- Displays test execution logs for debugging.
- Test results are saved in Firebase for future reference.

### **5. CI/CD Integration**
- Can be integrated with GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
- Runs tests automatically on code commits.
- Notifies developers of failures via email/slack.

### **6. User-Friendly Dashboard**
- Simple UI built with React & Tailwind CSS.
- Displays real-time test results.
- Includes a "Run Test" button to trigger tests instantly.

### **7. REST API Support**
- Exposes endpoints to trigger test runs.
- Can be used by third-party applications.
- Supports fetching test results programmatically.

### **8. Admin Panel**
- Admin authentication using Firebase Auth.
- Ability to manage test cases.
- View, edit, and delete test results stored in Firebase.
- View test execution logs.

## **Technical Stack**

### **Frontend**
- React.js for UI development
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Fetch API for communicating with backend

### **Backend**
- Node.js with Express.js
- Selenium WebDriver for automation
- Firebase Firestore for storing test results
- Mocha + Chai for additional test validation

---

## **Security & Performance Enhancements**
- **Secure API Endpoints**: Implements JWT authentication for API security.
- **Database Optimization**: Indexes frequently queried fields in Firebase.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Uses Google Lighthouse for UI performance testing.
- **Load Testing**: Integrates JMeter or k6 for simulating high traffic.

## **Project Structure**

```bash
TestMaster/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ server.js
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ firebaseConfig.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
```

To create this structure, use the following command:
```bash
mkdir -p TestMaster/{backend/{controllers,models,routes,tests,config},frontend/{src,components,pages}}
touch TestMaster/{backend/server.js,frontend/{App.js,index.js,firebaseConfig.js},package.json,README.md}
```

## **Installation & Setup**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/shaayar/Test_Master.git
  cd Test_Master
```

### **2. Set Up Backend**
```bash
  cd backend && npm install && node server.js
```

### **3. Set Up Frontend**
```bash
  cd frontend && npm install && npm start
```

### **4. Running Tests Manually**
```bash
  node backend/tests/test.js
```

## **API Endpoints**
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| GET | `/run-test` | Executes the test cases and returns results |
| GET | `/get-results` | Fetches previous test results from Firebase |
| GET | `/generate-report` | Generates and downloads an HTML test report |
| POST | `/admin/add-test` | Adds a new test case (Admin only) |
| DELETE | `/admin/delete-test/:id` | Deletes a test case (Admin only) |

---

## **Example Test Case (Selenium with Node.js)**
```js
const { Builder, By } = require("selenium-webdriver");
const admin = require("firebase-admin");
const serviceAccount = require("../config/firebase.json");
admin.initializeApp({ credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount) });
const db = admin.firestore();

async function runTest() {
    let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser("chrome").build();
    try {
        await driver.get("https://example.com");
        let title = await driver.getTitle();
        console.log("Page title is:", title);
        
        await db.collection("testResults").add({
            testName: "Page Title Test",
            status: "Success",
            timestamp: new Date()
        });
    } finally {
        await driver.quit();
    }
}

runTest();
```
